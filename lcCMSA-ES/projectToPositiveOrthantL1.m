function xProjected = projectToPositiveOrthantL1(x, A, b)
  % xProjected = projectToPositiveOrthantL1(x, A, b)
  %    Projects the given x into the positive orthant, i.e.,
  %    solves the optimization problem
  %    min_{x_opt}{||x_opt - x||_1}
  %    such that x >= 0 and Ax = b.
  %    Informally it computes an x_opt in the positive orthant
  %    with minimal L1 distance to the given
  %    x and fulfilling the constraints.
  %
  %    This optimization can be written as a standard
  %    linear programming problem.
  %
  %    min_{x_opt}{||x_opt - x||_1}
  %    = min_{x_opt}{sum_i{|(x_opt_i - x_i)|}}

  %    such that z >= 0
  %              z >= x_opt - x
  %              z >= -x_opt + x
  %              A * x_opt = b
  %              x_opt >= 0
  %
  %    Rewriting the constraints for the variables to optimize to be
  %    on the lhs yields
  %
  %    min 1' * z
  %    such that z >= 0
  %              z - x_opt >= -x

  %              A * x_opt = b
  %              x_opt >= 0.
